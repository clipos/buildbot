    """Docker latent worker for CLIP OS project builds

    .. warning::
        We may need to run the CLIP OS build environment Docker container as
        privileged (i.e. the container will have all the POSIX capabilities
        available and have full access to the devices of the host) for multiple
        reasons:

        1. cosmk makes use of squashfs files as support for the SDK container
           images. This requires to be able to create and manipulate loop
           devices (i.e. ``/dev/loop*``) to mount these squashfs files.
        2. ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` is also required to run OCI containers with the
           ``runc`` runtime (e.g. for SDK containers) for namespaces creation
           and for mountpoint creation.
        3. SDK containers can be shown some devices (such as ``/dev/kvm``) for
           special programs running within SDKs (e.g. libguestfs).

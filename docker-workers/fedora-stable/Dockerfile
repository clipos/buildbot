# This unprivileged user is not so unprivileged because it can still use sudo
# to get root privileges within the container.
# This strangeness is explained by the fact that cosmk automatically recalls
# itself through sudo to get root privileges but still lower its running
# privileges for sections of code that do not require root permissions (see the
# ElevatedPrivileges class and its usage in the cosmk Python project for
# further details).
